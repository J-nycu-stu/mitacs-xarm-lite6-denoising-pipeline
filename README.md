Scripts for robot arm motion control : **"line_motion_press_final.py"** and **"arc_motion_press_final.py"**

Python notebook for 24 fps video processing : **"image_process.ipynb"**

Demo video (The files are too big. You have to download the raw file if you want to check out the demo results.)  
1. **"original vs. processed.mp4"** is the demo video comparing the unprocessed and processed video at the same time.
2. **"Arc_motion.mp4"** and **"Line_motion.mp4"** are demo videos of arc and line motion of physical xArm Lite6.
